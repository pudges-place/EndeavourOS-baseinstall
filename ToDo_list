 Bug fixes
 
 2/20/2020  Fixed bug in install-base2.sh   
            Changed lines (approx 239 & 240) in "setup static IP address with user supplied static IP" section
            from ethernetdevice=$(ip -r | grep "default via" | awk '{print $5)  to ethernetdevice=$(ip r | awk 'NR==1{print $5}')
            from routerip=$(ip r | grep "default via" | awk '{print3}') to routerip=$(ip r | awk 'NR==1{print $3}')
 TODO list last amended 02/25/2020
 
 The install instructions last amended 03/06/2020
 
 03/06/2020 Feature added   The script will now optionally partition, format, and mount the DATA device
 which will be included in the /etc/fstab by the genfstab command.
 
 03/18/2020 Feature added   The script will not allow the user to choose the EndeavourOS ISO device.  Displays error, then allows retry.
 This works for both the OS device selection and the DATA device selection.
